    link: "https://issuu.com/trenducsd/docs/outofbounds",
    description: "With “Out of Bounds,” we have reached our final potential: we know who we are, we aren’t afraid to speak out and disrupt the norm. Out of Bounds captures what it means to be different, to push the boundaries, and break out of them entirely. People who do so are often ostracized for their differences—and yet, they forge on anyway and revolutionize culture as we know it. Out of Bounds \
    honors the artist's past and celebrates the independent spirit, particularly how it relates to our generation.",

    description: "The world changes, and us with it. We are growing every day, our wings strengthening. We become bigger, better versions of who we were yesterday. Metamorphosis is the very essence of worldly context at this very point in time, and us in it. Metamorphosis is our celebration of the past, present, and future. Metamorphosis is a declaration that you can be anything, anyone you want to be. \
    In this issue, we looked towards nature, to find our strength in the sea and the land. We looked inward at our own change. We looked outward and observed the changes all around us, in fashion, media, and popular culture, even in the faces of generations past. We celebrate Palestine and we celebrate queer identity. We grapple with the aches and pains of growing up. And we marvel at what is to come.",

    description: "Vault celebrates the underground, the deeply personal; items meaningful to us and nonsensical to others are still valued beyond these differences - an artistic act of self-expression. Vault is our enjoyment of the retro, the vintage, and the avant garde.",
